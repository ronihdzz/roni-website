This project was the result of intense teamwork, where each of us contributed ideas that evolved into a solid and effective proposal. Our solution impressed the jury so much that they began using our term 'los paros' to describe the project's dynamics. Winning the FEMSA Challenge was an exciting and very rewarding experience, especially given the quality of the other participating teams.

In the CDMX edition, together with my team, AstroFire, we won first place with our innovative proposal called 'Death Sensors'. This project consisted of a network of strategically placed sensors in forest areas to detect the speed and direction of fires. The sensors communicated with each other using the LORA protocol, forming a local network that enabled early alerts and facilitated rapid response to forest fires. Although it was an initial prototype (not with all functions), we managed to make it fully functional. Additionally, we developed both the hardware that captured the data and the website and mobile application, allowing us to showcase a prototype that impressed the jury with its effectiveness and potential, despite being a preliminary version.",
